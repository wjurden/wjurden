### Hi There, I Am Wes Jurden 👋

📍 I live in the PNW and call Portland, Oregon my homebase

👟 I work for Nike, Inc. as a Consumer Insights Analyst supporting the Jordan Brand

🎓 I'm currently a student at Oklahoma State University | M.S Business Analytics & Data Science

🏈 In my free time, I enjoy working on a [College Football Project](https://github.com/wjurden/college-football-project) (Huge fan of THE Ohio State University)

⛷ When I am not solving problems with data, I enjoy all things active and outdoors - skiing, hiking, camping, fitness, etc.
